Distributed systems are complex and incidents caused by service dependencies can be hard to test for. xk6-disruptor is an extension that adds fault injection capabilities to Grafana k6, a load testing tool. It allows engineers to reproduce and test failures in distributed systems, improving testing strategies and catching issues before they happen again. The article shares a fictitious incident faced by an engineering team working on a web application called QuickPizza and explains how they used xk6-disruptor to overcome the challenges.
